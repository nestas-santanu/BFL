We at nestas Consultancy, need to create an application to bring together people who wish to donate blood with those with a need for blood. 

The application will
1. have a mobile first approach
2. take advantage of open source technologies and databases

The application will be built in phases. The roadmap till phase 2 is as below. The current requirement is to fulfill Phase 1.

Phase 1:
In this phase we will create a mobile friendly web site 
1. that will be functional to create a database of donors
2. set standards for future enhancements
3. test out some of the integretaion challenges with 3rd party tools for sending SMS.
4. determine the database for the project

The site will have a means to:
1. allow a donor to register
2. allow a registered donor to update her/his details
3. allow a registered donor to opt out
4. post requirements for someone who requires blood
5. send requirement as a SMS to donors

The site will fulfill the following requirements, which will be mobile friendly:
1. a landing page (Home)
2. a page to register a donor. This page will also include a privacy policy.
3. a login for the registered donor
4. a page for a registerd donor to view and update her/his profile and opt out
5. a page for posting requirements by someone who requires blood
6. a page by which a posted requirement can be tracked
7. a background service to search donors by city/state/country for all the 3 or a given requirement and send an SMS to these donors.
8. a Contribution page. This page will detail how the people can contribute voluntarily in spreading the word about the site, translating the site to different languages, SEO improvements, make the features of the site SMS friendly, etc.
9. A common menu for all pages.
